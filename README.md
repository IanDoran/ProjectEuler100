# ProjectEuler100
Repository for my Project Euler code.

If you find yourself exploring my repository of Project Euler code I assume you are most likely a CodeNewbie like myself.  
As such you will most likely find an eclectic compilation of solutions here since I am just beginning down my coding journey.

Feel free to utilize any of the code here as you see fit.  
But make sure you take a stab at the solutions yourself first.  
If you find yourself on this journey as well, best of luck, I hope to see you again when we complete problem 100.
